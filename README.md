# Monte carlo simulation, Markov chain

## Overview
In supermarkets,  sections and  products are organised in a special manner in order to take the attention of the customers. This method predicts the customer behavior in a supermarket using customers' previous behaviors.  

This is created for the project 8 (Monte carlo simulation, Markov chain, Object oriented programming). It is an animated visualization with object-oriented programming in Python. The main idea in predicting a customer's next step is to determine the transition matrix that depends on probablities on each section. 


## Implementation of the Method 
A visualization of a market is created with different sections using a layer. This is an object oriented Python application.
Maximum 4 people are allowed to get into the supermarket at the same time. In the video below, you will see the simulation in a supermarket. When a customer reaches the checkout, you hear a cash register sound.
